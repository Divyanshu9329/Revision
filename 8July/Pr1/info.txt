we want to make that user fill all the inputs only then it adds data into the table
for that we will use form tag


form tag:
step    1. validation: it check all the inside the form tag if all clear the it moves to step 2nd

step    2. onsubmit event

step    3. data server send : in this step it sends data and refresh the page for new data entry


in this project we don't want the step 3 to happen as if this happen it removes the data from the screen.
